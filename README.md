A method that can further accelerate the simulation of N-Body Problems.

See the report for detailed illustration.

Core code is in main_prject/kernel.cu.

Executable maybe not runable because the environment issue, you can open Visual Studio and compile it by your self.

It also rely on glew and glfw, which I already provide in the repo.
